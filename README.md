# find_duplicated_files.sh
A shell script to search for duplicated/identical files on linux machines

The idea of this script started after spending few days searching on my home NAS server for duplicated files, because the free speace was less then 200GB from 2TB total disk size on NAS server.

I wanted something small and fast enough, so I've wrote it in bash.
